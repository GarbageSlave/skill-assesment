# BrynQ Applicant Assessment Starter

**Thank you for your interest in BrynQ!**

This is a starter project for the BrynQ Applicant Assessment. It is a full-stack project that uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run containerized services. The backend is a simple [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server that connects to a MySQL database using [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/). The frontend is a [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) application that uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool, [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for state management, and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
